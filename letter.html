    data-title="HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEST GIRL" 
    data-body="Happy Birthday Pauw,

On this special day, I want to take a moment to celebrate you, which is why I wrote this letter. I hope today brings you the joy you truly deserve. May this year be filled with good health, happiness, and more opportunities para sa mga pangarap mo. Always remember that there will always be people who are special to you. Your kindness and presence are things they treasure—and I’m one of the lucky ones who got to feel that.

Now, I’d like to say something more than just a birthday greeting. I want to apologize for what happened between us. I admit that my mood wasn’t fine when you were talking about how your day went, and for the things I said in the heat of our argument. It seems our relationship is now over, considering we haven’t communicated these past few weeks. So this might be my last letter, and that’s why I’m telling you all of this on your birthday.

First, I want to thank you for being my other half for almost three years. Thank you for being there and staying with me when times got rough. I know that in those almost three years we spent together, marami akong pagkakamali, and I completely understand if you choose not to forgive me, Pauw. If it’s your choice to end it now, I won’t object. Just know that being with you was definitely my favorite and one of the best feelings ever.

Salamat, Pauw, for teaching me, guiding me, and staying with me through all the mistakes I made. I know this letter might not make much sense, but I just wanted to let everything out. I’m sorry for always saying sorry. I’m sorry for being silent when we argued, for being emotionally unavailable, and for not knowing better ways to handle our fights. I know I should have done better, but I didn’t—and I recognize that.

I know this is your birthday, and I hate that I’m filling it with apologies, but aside from that, I also want to thank you for everything we’ve been through. I’m going to miss it all so much. I’ll miss everything we did, just like in the video I put on the website. I really hope you liked that site I made. Maybe it’s silly, especially since we’re already broken up, but building it felt like we were still together. At first, I thought of just adding your pictures, since maybe you wouldn’t like it if I put a picture of myself. But in the end, I just thought, “This might be my last gift for her,” so I went through with it.

Anyway, I’m rambling. Basically, if we are going to stay broken up, I still want to thank you for everything, Pauw. And I’m sorry for all the bad things that happened between us. Just know that those almost three years will always be unforgettable for me—and I’ll miss you. A lot. Like, a lot lot. Honestly, I’ve missed you these past few weeks. You might have thought I didn’t care, but the truth is, I always checked what you reposted—just to see what you were feeling.

So yeah… this might really be the last time I’ll say this, but: I love you, Pawi. Enjoy your birthday.

Again, happy 20th birthday! Enjoy it to the fullest, my love. Goodbye.">

    data-body="This letter is to greet you the HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY, my best girl. Happy 17th birthday, best girl. I wish you many more birthdays to come, even though you keep saying you won’t be able to reach that age, but I know you will. I wish you the fulfillment of all your life dreams and goals, as well as all the items on your bucket list. I hope that everything you desire comes to you at the right time. I hope that all of your prayers are answered. I wish you the ability to do the things you desire, and I wish you the best in everything, because you deserve it. I know that life will treat you well because you’re determined to achieve your dreams and goals, so that you can help out your family and do all the things you’ve always wanted to do, and I know that it will happen someday, because of your sheer determination. Everything you’ve worked so hard for will be given to you. You’re doing fantastic on your journey. I also want to express my gratitude for always being there for me. You were there for me when things got tough, worried about me when I got sick or got into an accident. Helping me with my assignment and modules, listening to all of my rants and problems, going out to lunch with me because I would eat alone, and everything else I’ve experienced with you. We’d have good days and bad days, but whenever I was with you, it was the best. I really appreciate everything we do, and I always tell myself that I’m so lucky to be able to talk to you and that you’re a part of my life. So thank you so much for being the definition of home, amore. And I'd like to ask you about it as well. If you agree to let me court you? HAPPY BIRTHDAY AGAIN, BEST GIRL!">

    data-body="Hellooooo, it's our second monthsaryyy todayyy. We did hang out today, but only for a short while, babi. Which is unfortunate because I was unable to spend the day with you due to school. But I still enjoyed our time together today. We ate two of your cravings today, ice cream and cotton candy, which you were overjoyed about because you could taste them, and I hope you enjoyed the burger I gave you yesterday. You deserved it because you said you wanted it, but I really wanted to treat you to your cravings because I knew how stressed and busy you were, which is why I went to get you burgers. Anyway, babi, happy monthsaryyy. I hope I get to spend more months with you, with your chikas, and with you scolding me for acting like a child. I can't wait for December break so we can watch Spy x Family Season 2 na together and go on dates. We'll be able to go out n rin now that December break is approaching. You're sleeping as I write this letter to you, and I'm not sure if you'll even open it because you didn't want me to make you one because you thought I wouldn't make you another one if you didn't tell me, even though I was going to make you one after my activities and now you've fallen asleep. Suprisee, I made one :>. Hellooo, babi, if you did open this. I just wanted to say how proud I am of everything you do. You give your all in everything, and I appreciate how much effort you put into finishing things, which is one of the qualities I admire in you. I love how you always look, how you dress, your beautiful wide smile, your hazel brown eyes, you acting like a mom:>, the chikas you tell, how you laugh, talking about the things you want and wanted. I adore them all. Oh, how I wish I could keep seeing this for the rest of my life. Oh, life would be the best. My tranquility, amore, sanctuary, home, serenity, babi, pawi, peace, and pauw. I adore you. More months together to enjoy and have fun together.">

    data-title="Happy 3rd Monthsary and a HAPPY NEW YEARR babiiii" 
    data-body="Helloooo, babi. First and foremost, HAPPY NEW YEAR and HAPPY 3RD MONTHSARY. I get to ring in the new year with you, and it's also our third month anniversary. I'm glad I get to approach 2023 with you, the most wonderful partner ever, and I hope we get to approach many more years together. Happy 3rd Monthsary, babi. I can't express how thankful I am to have you in my life. You always make me happy and bring a smile to my face. You bring out my true smile. You are my joy, my person, and my home. Whatever happens between us, I will always care for you. I'd rather fix things with you than break up. I wouldn't want to start over with someone else; I'd rather start over with you a million times. I'm hoping I don't lose you. I know we've had our ups and downs, but that doesn't stop me from loving you; I'll always love you the same way. My love for you grows stronger with each passing day; I'm so attached and in love with you that it's insane. I know we have disagreements from time to time, but I would rather fix a million times than meet someone new. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You made me feel loved, and you taught me how to love once more. And I can't imagine loving anyone other than you. I will be eternally grateful for the opportunity. I will be eternally grateful for the opportunity to spend time with you. We may not always understand each other, but I will still choose you every day. I know we're too young, but I'd like to grow old alongside you. Because, despite our youth and inexperience, I believe this is the love I desire and deserve. I used to struggle to find meaning in my life, but now I wake up feeling like every day has a purpose. Your soft and charming voice soothes my mind, your touch stops my trembling, your lovely smile energizes me, and your presence gives me life. You know how to love me properly, and you are unquestionably the best girlfriend. You know I've always been indecisive as a kid but I know that I've never been this sure about something in my life. We are still young and we still have a lot to go through and will always be beyond grateful for the opportunity to be with you, learn to live life and grow with you. I find nothing but love for you, amore. I know you have issues and worry about your insecurities. Yet, when I laid my eyes on you, I never went back. The flaws that you say you have, are a part of you that made me admire you as a woman. I love the parts that you never thought could be loved or ever loved again, I want to show you how much I love you and know that it would take an eternity to express. I also know that I will never be a perfect partner but I will always try my best. You taught me alot of things. I hope you wont get tired of our relationship if we're being challenged by destiny. There will be times when we don't see beyond our differences, get on each other's nerves with careless words we throw. But know that I will stay babi. Anyways, HAPPY NEW YEAR AND HAPPY 3RD MONTHSARY BABII. Luv ü sm">

This past month has been nothing but filled with amazing things that happened between the two of us, we finally got to see each other po again after these past few months, and I wanna thank you for going home because I really needed that peace, and tranquility. That you always give me whenever I'm with you. I was able to finally see my lovie, and  It might have been a brief of being able to see you, but other than I'm really grateful of it because we shared so much moments and memories with you in such a brief amount of time. Oh I have missed your smell, warmth, hugs, and kisses so much, that I could just wish that everyday is just like this. Living a life with you.

As we celebrate po our monthsary, I just wanna say that we have finally praised our God together po, lovie. Like what you always prayed, it finally happened. I also thank you for bringing me closer to God, lovie. If it weren't for you I would probably be the same old me.

This month was just us missing each other a lot and a few arguments here and there. I wanna thank you again for the memories that we did together in this month, sa mga bardagulan po natin and sa pangungulila sa isa't isa.

And yesterday I know we had an argument about me not updating po, and you're right it is my fault po, no one should beg for an update and that I wasn't acting like how a boyfriend should act. That is not how I should suppose to act po, and that I will reflect on the things that you said about me po, babi. But I wanna thank you po na kahit ilang beses na away, ilang beses na bardagulan, and sometimes misunderstanding you're always there to guide me of the things that I should be doing and the don'ts. I don't really know how I would be myself right now if it wasn't for you po. Thank you for being there for me when times I don't know what to do with myself, for times that I would be crying because I pity myself, or someone. For being my all in one, whether you'll act like a mom, a child, a girlfriend, and most especially a wife, my wifey.

Ofcourse there a lot more because we went to the church together and even recreated your birthday pictures again with a different dress. You really looked gorgeous wearing that red dreamy dress especially adding your beautiful smile make it just so perfect. I hope you also enjoyed the time that I was with you, babi. Wanting and craving for more moments like those with you. Maybe sometime in the future we'll be able to experience that everyday together. Let's keep working together so one day, we can achieve those dream that we are bound for, together.

Again, Happy 21st monthsaryy to us both my blooming soon to be CPA girlfriend, may God be with us throughout our journey together! Love you! ">

    data-body="Hello to again to my one and only babi

It's our 22nd Monthsary po naa. Lapit na po yung anniversary natinn together po! Yeyyy, excited na me nyahaha. So I hope we'll continue our together to reach our 2nd anniversary together, and ofcourse many more :D

Alot has happened between us po this july po, alot of fun memories between us together po but also lots of arguments here and there po to the point that we both almost broke up because of alot of misunderstandings. I know po that we often mostly get into arguments because of my decisions po, and yes I'm most often aware of that po, babi. I'm sorry po for all the poorly decision I have made in all the year and months that I have been with you po, babi. You also said that I have changed the way I used to be, and you're right po. I'll do my best to bring back the way that I have spoiled you po back then, babi.

Thank you po for also being the one who brought life into my life when I met you po. You gave me the reason the life is worth enjoying, and isn't so bad after all. You made me realize that there is so much to do, like growing old with, enjoying life after graduation, cheering for each other's achievement in our jobs, having kids, and travelling to places that we've never seen. I wanted to experience that life, with you pauw. That's why I hope that you'll bear with me through all the tough times that we'll face but I also want you support and have fun with me through all the good memories that we'll also make.

I wanna thank you for the times of supporting me whenever I feel down, or not in the mood for something. Whether by talking sense to me, or just straight up comfort me and to be honest po, I really enjoy you just straight up comforting, because it gives me the tickles and warmth hehe.

I also wanna thank you po, babi. For being a mom, a sister, a friend, a girlfriend to me po. You pick whatever you think is the right choice for when I'm being silly or stupid and what not. Like I'm your baby. But I am, aren't I? HAHAHAHAH

But of all of that, I would wanna thank you for being with me for 22nd months of rollercoaster of emotions. Thank you for staying with me through all those time, babi. I hope we can do so many moree stuff together po. I wouldn't want anybody else to experience all the things this world could offer except for you po. To more years and monthsary of us po, babi. Again, Happy happy 22nd Monthsaryy po, babi, amore, pauw, pawi, love, loviee, and ofcouse a personal favourite I think would be a great nickname for you would be wife/wifey :> ehhh that was slick aint it? HAHAHA I'm still so informal with my letters.

Love,

I'll try to make this a bit more formal now because its an anniversary letter hehe

Today marks the day that you accepted me to be your someone, your best friend, your boyfriend, and your rikki. I can't even believe that we're already in our 2nd anniversary because time goes on by fast whenever I'm with you.

The time that we have spent together taught me together that even in the smallest thing that you do for me is what makes me love you more, how you care for me when I'm feeling down, the way that you pray when I was sick, and how you encourage me to always become a better version of myself.

As your best friend, your boyfriend, and your rikki. Whether we're enjoying laughing, facing challenges together, or even enjoying the quiet times whenever we're together, through all those I would always choose to be by your side.

Thank you, love for the wonderful two years that you have given me to be with you. I look forward to making more memories, and growth together!

Cheers to many more anniversaries, love.">

It's our monthsary past our 2nd anniversary YIPEEEEE! I'll go back to the good old informal letter that I always write on our monthsary hehe. Can't believe we are past our 2nd anniversary na, dati nag uusap lang us phone (I mean hanggang ngayon pa rin naman xD), pero ngayon parang kulang ang lahat ng bagay kapag hindi ka kasama.
You're basically my other half at this point. 

For our 25th monthsary of course I wanna thank you for all the moments that you have shared with me, through all the challenges and joy that we faced together po. Sure, as always po there are times na hindi madali saatin, pero there's nothing more that could fix it but a good communication between the two of us po. Thank you po for loving me for the person that I am today, and thank you rin po sa walang sawang paginintindi saakin hehe

Lastly, I hope we can continue to strive together in our relationship, love. That we're always there for one another. Cheers to more months, years with you love!

    data-body="Hallo hallo love lovee

Today marks another day to celebrate the relationship that we have over the past 2 and counting :DD and everyday that I'm with is a blessing itself, ofcourse today is a little special because we are celebrating our relationship together.

January was sure a long month for us but the remaining days that we've been able to spend together on the first week was amazing, I hope we can see each other again po once the semester ends, and I really really hope that you can visit me here in Baguio once it over so we can finally visit the tourist spots here because partly I wanna travel them kasama po ikaw.

Ofcourse, school has started and I know that we're going to be busy on somedays and that is okay :D. Ofcourse you'll be the most busy mostly because it is the time for the qualifying exam po ngayon, and I hope and I know that you will pass it. I believe in you po, but still ofcourse I wanna say goodluck po sa exam mo love. You'll do great :D

Anyways, I wanna say thank you for being patience, kind, and for being a beautiful girlfriend inside and out. I'm still grateful po that you have been a part of my life, and myself. Considering all the challenges the faced, we are still here, together.

Lastly, partly because nangulila ako while making I miss you na po so much, lovie. I miss the way we spent the little time whenever we are together, time going so fast that we don't even notice to the point that we are disappointed cause time way faster than it supposed to and that we don't have enough time to spend it together. I miss the way I gently touch your soft skin, silky hair whenever you want to sleep or when you're sleeping. The warmth that I feel when we're cuddling, and your hazy eyes that looks majestic when the sun hits it. Your little dance when you enjoy or get your cravings. You in a dress, just showered, in pajamas. I MISS IT ALLLL. Ehem, that's all hehe

I look forward to being with you po again so we can do more stuff together, and ofcourse to many more months and years with you! Love you po so much, mi amore!

Yours truly,

It is our 29th Monthsary already, and I can't even believe it kasi ambilis po if you think about it. Time flies so fast, that we're on our 29th Monthsary, it felt like it just been months of us being in Senior High School, and always being together. Anyways enough with reminiscing. Lets get on the main point of the letter po hehe, sorry po nadistract.

Firstly po, I wanna thank you po for always being by my side babi, for always understanding me kahit na I mostly don't have the right words to tell you how much you mean to me. Through the ups and downs, you were always there patiently listening to me. Thank you for loving me the way you do. Thank you rin po for reminding of things that I need to do, and to know. You guide me to be better and I'm very much grateful for that po.

I also wanna sorry po through our ups and downs. We may have arguments here and there po, and I'm sorry for not being the one who takes the iniative to say sorry na po, pawi. Like you said, I did really change, but for the worse, and hopefully I can change it now po. I think I'm making progress now po though, I bought groceries earlier and I'm listing my expenses per day now so I know where my money is going, and tryna be clean as much as possible po dito sa boarding ^^

Anyways, that's not what that is about HAHA. This is all I have to say po, pawi. Thank you po for existing. Thank you for existing that I got to spend my time with you, is what I mean. And yes, I do look forward to spending more days with you, building memories together, until the end. Happy 29th Monthsary, babi!">

    data-body="Hello, and a Happy Monthsary po to us, pawi. This day might not be specifically a happy monthsary for us considering that we had an argument last night, and we haven't talked much today. I'm sorry po for the things you were mad about last night. You're right that I don't directly message tita if how she is doing and such. I will message her now po also whenever I get to talk with dad po. There was also the argument that you we're complaning about my budgeting and I don't manage my money properly by not taking notes on all the things that I bought with the money I have this month. I'm also sorry about this, I guess I probably enjoyed the 1 week vacation to much. I will now write my expenses like I used to, so I know where my money is going. This monthsary unfortunately became a Apology Letter, but I just wanna clear things up before I wanna greet you a Happy Monthsary. This is just one of our many ups and down in our relationship. But I hope that through it all, you'll always be there supporting for me every step that I take in my life. Again, I'm sorry about our argument po, but thank you rin po, babi. For looking out for me po. I appreciate it.

Okieee, first of all we got to finally hang out after out semester, yippee!! I get to finally hang out with my favourite person, my beautiful wifey, my best friend, and ofcourse a lot more cause it would just keep going po. I had so much fun po on the times that we have spent together, 

We went to Milas, our first usual spot to eat them juicies spaghetti and was about to even teach you how to drive a motorcycle nyahahaha but I guess we go with the bike first :>, anyways that was fun. Next one was you going here po sa last night ni tatang to catch up po kanila mara, aryanne, and ofcourse po the both of us, since yung motor po nasira and wala po me magamit na papunta po dyan. And the next one would be our first sleepover together, we finally got to sleep next to each other, and boi was it an experience po xD. We weren't able to sleep because y'know po :D. (Idk if I should add the freaky stuff cause I want this to be wholesome but at the same time I feel like the things we did feels wholesome cause we keep giggling about it). And, I get to see your sleepy face (Goodness you're still so gorgeous even when you're sleepy.) Can't wait to see that everyday. Honestly, I keep waking up cause my body keeps telling me I might have woken you up from how I sleep T_T. We also had breakfast together :D. It was definitely a chaotic fun sleepover po, and I enjoyed every part of it. Hope that we get to do more sleepover po ^^, And ofcourse, the time we spent together yesterday. We might be tired from that, to the point to you even got sick po (I'll go there tomorrow para i'll take care po kita whether you are still sick or not hehe) But we had alot of fun from thattt. From going po sa santiago, to eating jabee with thea pot pot, to buy stuff with, and even going to the arcade to play basketball, sing, and hockeyyy. All the way to going home. I have so much whenever we do stuff together po, and I wanna thank you po for all of this. I had so much fun and memorable memories this summer today, and ofcourse we'll do more of this because summer ain't over yet nyahahaha. So better be ready for me po tomorrow, we gon have fun whether you are sick or not po :D.

Anyways, all I wanna say po is I wanna do more of this joyful and fun memories throughout my life with you po, lovie. So, I wanna thank you po for still sticking on me even when times get rough between us po. I'm sorry about our last argument of you feeling like you're the only one carrying our relationship and that I myself took too long to realize it, and I wanna thank you for giving me the chance to change that po. Although I feel like you still are, babi. You've been spoiling me from all the times that we spent po T_T. You don't even want me to spend stuff on you naaa, lemme buyy you something, babiiii. So ayonn po, lovie. Thank you, thank you so much for a wonderful summer filled with happiness because of you po. Would gladly do more stuff with you po. Happy 32nd Monthsary po again to the both of us love!

Today marks another month of us being together. This is our 33rd Monthsary and we're are so close for our 2nd anniversary, just a few more months nyahahaha. The time of the month that we are going to be long distance relationship again, because you already have classes. But as always, we can do this together even though we are far away from each other >:D.

I know going away from our province takes a lot of courage and determination to keep going to a place that you don't want to go back anymore, and I just wanna say that I'm proud of you po, lovie. On being able to keep going po. Very much proud of you po, love. That's why just a few more years po, and you're gonna graduate na soon po! Yipee, and don't worry po I'll definitely be there kapag hehe. Just keep going, love!

We've also grown so much po together. Physically and emotionally po. How being in argument and us calming down together to talk properly was definitely a step forward for us po, and ofcourse there still room for us to grow to po and I hope that we continue to do so po. Ofcourse, I also can't forget the advice that you have given me po, love. Thank you for the advice that you have given me last week. You're right po, and maybe I should start making it a goal and not just out of motivation. Especially now that kasama ko na po si aryanne dito sa Baguio.

But ofcourse, I wanna thank you po for all times that you have been patient with me, for accepting me as I am but continuing to love me and support to do better everyday through all the things that we've been through. I assure you that I will keep choosing you, through the bad times, and good times, everyday.

Happy 33rd monthsary, pawi, lovie, amore, babi, wifey, miss you (ay hindi pala call sign natin, sorry nasobrahan sa damdamin) xD

    data-body="Hello po, lovie! Today marks another month being together with you po. I firstly wanna start off by saying thank you for staying with me through the ups and down of our relationship po. I'm sorry for all the arguments that happened just because I did something wrong or changed something I'm supposed to change. But still, despite all those, we're still together staying strong for each other and learning to properly talk to each other. I'd be lying if I still said that being far would be easy, but it's not. We can't properly process our feelings for each other personally, and there is the other thing of not being able to hug each other, and missing you everyday. It hurts you know. Because I miss your presence everyday. To just chilling together, doing something, anything. As long as it's you, everything would be better. Thank you for making me feel this way, love. I wouldn't have anyone else to do more stuff with you, and hope do more monthsary with you! 

Happy 34th Monthsary again, love! Thank you for being apart of my life.  ">
